## Goal

The Simba Project is a school project realized by a group of students from the ESIR school. 

Simba organizer is a planning and survey application that can be used in a professional, friendly or associative context to plan and coordinate a meeting. Indeed, it allows you to easily find a date but also a common time slot to gather several people. For that, it couldn't be easier. First, the event organizer creates the poll and proposes several date choices. Then, the people invited vote for the dates that best suit them. This way, the organizer will be able to choose the best option. 

Simba organizer also offers several features such as the ability to post comments, indicate food preferences or export the survey. This also includes a chat and an etherpad generated from the survey data.

## How to use

You will find a `readme.md` on both api and web folders explaining how to install, launch and use the application.
